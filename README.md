#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I interperet user needs by asking narrowing questions in order to get the most precise idea of the wants and needs for the product.  Once I have the best description of the client's desires that I can create, I begin to turn those desires into user stories.  By breaking down the needs of the client into user stories, I give the development team smaller parcels of the whole which they can then take, estimate, and produce the product needed to satisfy those user stories.  User stories keep the project managable.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

   I approach developing a program by determining what outcome is desired.  From there, I try to come up with the most logical solution to how that should come about.  I have no experience working on anything other than small programs in my programming course, so it's hard for me to picture what it might be like working with others in a team building a small part of a larger whole. I would certainly look forward to implementing pair programming into my work habits.  Being able to learn from a developer who has been in the field for years would certainly build my skillset.  The other agile process I'd be interested in implementing is designing tests then programming to meat those tests.  Integrating the testing directlky into the developpment is what I consider one of the most advanced aspects of Agile.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good team member is first and foremost there everyday and involved in all team events.  They will be courteous, straightforward, and truthful.  They will keep personal issues personal and directly discuss all work issues as needed with those who are affected or involved.  They will strive to get all work done in a timely manner and dedicate themselves to the project at hand.  They will assist the team with any need and put themselves forward to do the work that they know that they are capable of.  A good team member will put forth his best effort no matter what the task they are assigned.
